<marquee>I LOVE THE gym. There’s nothing quite like the feeling you get after a long row on the rowing machine or 40 minutes of hard cardio. It’s a key part of my mental health routine  along with a healthy diet, a very good therapist and some strong antidepressants. 
In another life maybe I would have been a strong advocate for keeping the gyms open in Level 5. As someone who suffers from both depression and anxiety, the news that gyms would not be kept open in Level 5 did upset me.
Being able to go back to the gym in July boosted my mental and physical wellbeing immensely. I was able to re-establish my routine and get out of my apartment at least twice a week...</marquee>
